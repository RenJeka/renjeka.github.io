### ABOUT PORTFOLIO: 
#####Portfolio shows my experience in programming:
###### You can visit the portfolio by link: https://renjeka.github.io

* HTML & CSS knoweledges (+ preprocessors, etc.)
* JS knoweledges (+ builders, libraries, etc.)
* Angular knoweledges and related technologies
* Knowledges in back-end development (PHP, Java, SQL)
* Knowledges in various services (AWS)


######The portfolio site itself is implemented using the webpack builder, sass preprocessor and web-components

Since I work in companies most of the time, there is not much time for PET projects. Therefore, here are collected only some parts of my experience.

In the future, I plan to expand my portfolio to demonstrate knowledge of a strong middle frontend developer
 (including design patterns and client-server architecture) as well as knowledge of back-end programming languages
  (Java, NodeJS, Python etc.), and of course not to forget about technologies that are popular ( Docker, AWS, etc.).
